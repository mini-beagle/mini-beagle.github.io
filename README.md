Some web apps I made for fun and/or learning purposes.

# BLONOTE
This app uses YouTube's API to serve up (mostly) instrumental version of songs by Korean hip hop group Epik High alongside the gentle sounds of a rainy evening. The various quotes come from the book *Blonote*, written by Epik High's frontman, Tablo.
