As I began working my way through the MkDocs documentation, however, I quickly became a fan for the following reasons:</p> <ul> <li>Easy to install and configure. Despite my limited experience with static site generators, MkDocs made it incredibly easy to get up and running.</li> <li>Customizable look and feel. While it does have some limitations, MkDocs offers enough flexibility to give my site its own flavor to match my needs.</li> <li>Trusted by industry leaders. If it's good enough for companies like Atlassian and Mozilla, it's good enough for me.</li> <li>Markdown. When it comes to writing documentation, Markdown feels infinitely cleaner than dealing with HTML (though I'm comfortable with both!). Markdown's portability is another plus.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"index.html#how-did-i-build-this","title":"How Did I Build This?","text":"<p>The MkDocs site has a wonderful Getting Started with MkDocs topic that had me building a brand new site in minutes. Of course, after that, I did have to spend some time digging through documentation to configure the look and feel, install plugins, and create the actual written content.</p> <p>For hosting, I opted to use GitHub Pages, which serves as a great free option for small projects like this.</p>"},{"location":"index.html#whats-next","title":"What's Next?","text":"<p>In the coming days/weeks, I anticipate continuing to grow this site, hopefully generating something that feels more like a true documentation repository.</p>"},{"location":"about.html","title":"About","text":"<p>Please refer to my main portfolio page to learn more about me and my work :)</p>"}]}
