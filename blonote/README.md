# BLONOTE
BLONOTE is a web app that pairs soothing music and rain sounds with quotes from the book *BLONOTE*, a collection of thoughts, reflections, and pithy statements by Korean hip hop artist Tablo.

## 220613 Update

For the first time since I created this project, I've done some updates. While I wouldn't say this is now a living project, I did feel it was right to do a few changes, namely:

1. Adding this README
2. Adding music and video credits to the README (sorry, should have done this sooner!)
3. Updated music playlist to remove now broken music links
4. A couple of minor UI tweaks

Hope you enjoy :)
